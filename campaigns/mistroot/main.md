Start: Tarben Mistroot's manor


# the manor: 6PM
    + describe the "manor"
    + Tarben asks what you would like for payment
        * wont take no for an answer. You must watch her. You agreed to.
    + It's okay if you sleep in our room
    + We are both leaving
        * Tarben is headed to gamble and then buy material
        * Aelen is headed on a secret mission
    * Aelen tells Eva that she must obey
    * Aelen whispers to not let her leave
    * Eva knows what she's saying, storms into the bedroom
    * Tarben and Aelen leave.
# with Eva: 6:30
    * Eva asks about PC equipment, background
    * Eva goes behind a house, grabs a bow and some arrows, and a target hidden behind - she's testing PC
    * time to go to sleep
    * 2 poisonous snakes have moved in while you were outside
        50 XP, a medium encounter
# Eva leaves
    * At some point, Eva wants to sneak off - no matter what. If she is very impressed by combat abilities, she will invite the PC.
    * If she manages to do it in secret, she will leave a note saying where she went
    * She goes there, maybe stays outside of it and cries, nervous after seeing blood on the ground
