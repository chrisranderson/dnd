To Kriv on a long rest:
As you fell asleep, you watch as an incorporeal observer in a home you don’t recognize, a poorly put together hut, with dirt floors. You are standing in the entrance, facing the room. As you look around, you are surprised to sense someone walking through you - a young female human, clearly distressed. She quickly fetches something you can’t see clearly, and takes it outside. Whatever it is does not satisfy her master, an older human, clearly drunk; outraged by her offering which somehow you recognize to be entirely sufficient, he stumbles towards her and hits her with the back of his hand, causing her to fall to the ground, her face hidden from you.

As you recoil from the scene of the strike, she continues to cry. Her crying slows. Involuntarily, you kneel down next to her to see what support you can offer, though you know it’s impossible for you to help. She calms down after a minute, her face still away from you. She slowly turns her face towards you to reveal some horrible combination of her own youthful face with the gnarled greenish skin of Akbug the goblin. Suddenly, you realize that you are physically present in this strange dream. She looks at you with betrayal and tears in her oversized, yellowed eyes. Her face inexplicably shifts to a face you recognize - one of the old men from your travels near your homeland. It shifts a second later to another villager, a young boy. It shifts more quickly, again and again, faster and faster, all faces you recognize. They shift and shift until the faces all blur together and the dream ends.io-[2-==[[
