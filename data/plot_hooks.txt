At some point later in the story, have the cleric be revealed as a minor/major BBEG who became obsessed with his research and is after the PCs hand.

As the quest progresses, it's clear that this is not, and really never was his lair.
The Fire Princess A small humanoid fire elemental asks to be freed from a containing vessel. Once free she may give the party a reward (e.g. a fire ruby witch can be consumed to throw a Fireball or sold as jewelery). She them appears in random fires, such as torches in a dungeon, to talk to the party or give them a small, strange task. Once the players prove their value and her trust she asks them to help the fire kingdom in the elemental plane. The elemental convergence, an event that decides which element will prevail over the others in the material plane for the next 10 thousand years, is near and war is imminent. Plot twist: even though she keeps saying that an era of fire would bring life, light and warmth to the material plane the truth is that no element ever wins the convergence and this is what keeps the material plane balanced.

Hats (and Heads) Off: The players arrive at a town where everyone is on edge following the discovery of headless townsfolk outside town. No one knows what's causing the rash of headlessness, and the town guard would really appreciate it if the adventurers were to figure out why it keeps happening. While investigating, the party finds a fancy hat that looks like the hat a lord or lady might wear. How it got outside of this poor farming town is a mystery. There are no signs of magic on it, and it looks and feels just like an ordinary hat. Unbeknownst to the party though, a clutch of young mimics live in the area, and have learned the neat trick of looking like a hat causes people to pick you up and put you on their heads so you can then proceed to bite their heads off. Is one of the party members HEADed for disaster and decides to put the hat on? Will they discard it and then wonder why townfolk's heads keep disappearing? What will they do when the clutch becomes brazen enough that a half dozen or so 'hats' line the road?
Of Cur's Blood: Due to a recent famine, many of the townspeople have been eating dog meat just to stay alive. Soon after, many have heard of large packs of dogs ambushing travelers outside town.
The Giant's Pact: A town that was promised protection from a giant in return for food, has gone back on their deal and refuses to help feed the giant. Thanks to all the protection, the town has deforested the surrounding lands with farms without contest. Because of this, the giant is beginning to starve without anything to hunt, so he has begun stealing cattle from farmers.
The Curse of Royalty: The town royalty (king, duke, lord, etc.) is looking for someone to help cure his son from a very terrible curse. When his son is exposed to the sunlight, he shrinks to the size of a copper piece. The local wizard says he can only be cured if said royalty gives up all his gold.
The Mysterious Traveler Along the road when traveling, the party encounters a small gnome with an enormous backpack nearly 4x his size filled with all sorts of knick-nacks, and trinkets. After offering to sell some of these small interesting items, he asks the party if they would mind finding a long lost treasure he has been seeking called the Coin of a Thousand Sides. This coin, when turned over, may appear to be any currency the holder desires.
The Tar Pits: Along the road when traveling, the party encounters a lowland covered in tar pits. In the center of the lowland there is a dwarf stuck in the pit. Every effort to get him out is futile. He asks the party, as his final wish, to enact revenge on his brother who lured him here and pushed him into the pit
Gender Bender One morning when the party awakes from a long rest, a party member realizes that they are not the gender that they were before. Inside his backpack he finds a note that says 'Drink from me fountain, and ye may become a man/woman again.' The note also has a crudely drawn map that points to a small fountain with a badly drawn goblin standing next to it.
Lords and Ladles: A celebrated Dragonborn cook has gone missing on the eve of the spring festival, and the local baroness is at wits end to either find the poor sot, or provide a suitable replacement. To complicate matters further, a series of portents (the appearance of a blood-red star, the blossoming of a long-dead tree in the castle courtyard, the water in the ancient fountain in town square belching forth what appears to be blood, etc.) matching an ancient prophecy foretelling the return of a threatening (but vaguely defined) foe has the local churches and peacekeepers on edge, and some of the more influential townspeople are calling for the cancellation of the festival altogether. Others are hesitant - apparently this is far from the first time the spring festival hasn't gone to plan.
The Voyage of the Mimmi A village has a stone tower that serves little apparent purpose, and mostly serves as a place for teenagers make out away from the prying eyes of parents and village elders. Recently, however, a large vessel of foreign design has appeared daily, descending from above the clouds to dock with the top of the tower for an hour or two before ascending back into the heavens. The blacksmith's daughter - a wilful creature - left on the ship two days ago, and hasn't returned.
The Thirteenth Warforged: The Thrice-Crowned Emperor has grown old, and his advisors are beginning to worry that the long-delayed discussion of who (or what) should succeed his centuries-long rule will come too late. Noticeably mum on the subject is Thirteen, the last(?) of a series of mechanical servants created for the Emperor in his youth, and closest advisor to His Eminence. Long-silenced rumors have resurfaced that the Emperor's livelihood is directly tied to the wellbeing of the automatons, and the reactivation of long-defunct factories beneath the palace have spurred speculation that not all is as it seems.
The Necromancer A Mysterious Necromancer comes to your party asking for aid in exhuming dead bodies from the local cemetary. It is unclear what he needs the bodies for but he is offering to pay you with what your heart most desires.
Undead Pest Removal While imbibing at a pub in town, your group finds a note on the wall from a local farmer asking for help with undead roaming his fields in the night and destroying his crops. Upon talking with the man, he believes something in the crypt on his property is stirring the dead. He is offering your group a hearty meal and drinks, and whatever you find in the crypt is yours to keep.
The Empty Town: Upon entering the town that was supposed to be camp for the night, your party discovers that the town is completely empty. Seeing a light in a church nearby, your party investigates. They find the entire town residing in the catacombs under the church. The party learns that the town has been terrorized nightly by a mysterious beast that eats children, soon the towns population of children will reach zero and the town will wither away unless your party can slay this mysterious beast, whatever it may be.
The Dragon King Awakens Long ago, before Human Civilization emerged, the dragons ruled the lands. The evil king of the dragons ruled with no care for any of the other races. His ultimate goal was to exterminate anything not a dragon, anything impure. The Dragon was killed by a lone adventurer, inspired by the death of his love. Thousands of years later, a cult has emerged, seeking to resurrect their king, and they are on the verge of success. Will they be stopped, or will the Dragon King rise again?
Ways and Memes: Someone is drawing the local citizens in unflattering ways, such as the local butcher chopping up local children with the caption 'You dannae expect me to pay for real meat, do ya?' and posting the pictures in various places around the city. The city guard can't seem to catch the rapscallion, and now the city is offering a nice sized reward to whoever can catch the culprit. Can the party determine who the jolly joker is, or will they instead find themselves the caricaturist's next subject?
Silence of the Shams: A known grifter and confidence man has been arrested after breaking into the magistrate's private club and declaring his guilt to all assembled, describing at length everyone he's ever swindled, cheated, and/or hustled. He also implicates your party's (rogue/fighter/warlock), claiming that they were partners in all of it.
Three Men and a Baba: A hag has terrorized the fens North of Glynnflldych for as long as anyone can remember, stealing lambs from the farmers and making strange demands from travelers passing along the fen road. The village tolerates her, mostly because the hag keeps the local bullywugs at bay, but a trio of brothers demanding her eviction have rallied a growing number of locals to their side, and they're looking for some muscle.
The chosen... two?: There are rumours of 'The chosen one' or 'The returned one' or whatever it is that the party's 'Special Butterfly' is. Only it's someone else. Some other person is running about gaining fame on the PC's gimmick. The PC may get flak for something they've not done, or suffer scrutiny they don't want if they're mean to be a hidden heir to the kingdom. Is this 'other chosen' a fake? The true heir/chosen one? A doppelg�nger? Is the PC the doppelg�nger?
The Ancient Heir: The party find a Lich at the bottom of a dungeon, and defeat and contain it, although they are unable to permanently destroy it. Amongst the Lich's treasure are things marked with a specific coat of arms. If they investigate, they will discover that the lich was actually the heir to the kingdom, thought lost and dead some centuries ago - and technically Lichdom doesn't count as 'death' as far as the laws of succession are concerned...
What Is Dead May Never Die: There is a massive shift in the spiritual world. Clerics of a specific god - including one of the PCs - find their spells have changed overnight - almost as if their god's domain had suddenly shifted. There are other strange signs. Statues or images of their god start to corrode, rot or crumble away. The signs and portents of their spells change. Instead of ravens as messenger spirits, bats. Instead of green flames, blue. Eventually, the PCs learn that somehow this god has been killed and replaced. An epic-level adventurer climbed the difficult path to the heavens and usurped this deity. Can the PCs journey to the Underworld and retrieve the slain god? Or will they throw their lot in with the newcomer? Even if they do manage to resurrect their god, will they be changed by their time with Death?
The Rat Pack: The party is wandering the roads, when they encounter a minstrel troupe, who ask where the party is headed. No matter which way they say they're going, the troupe says they're headed in that direction as well, and could they travel with the party as they're feeling a little nervous since the mercs they were paying to guard them, betrayed them instead and ran off with the troupe's money. Even if the party refuses them, the troupe will follow them closely, when confronted, they will admit that they're scared the mercs might come back and finish them off, or some other menace might get them. So, by staying close to the party, they hope things will be scared off. That night, while the party sleeps, the party member(s) on guard will find themselves suddenly attacked with a concerted barrage of mesmerize, charm, sleep, or other mind affecting spells. It turns out that the wandering troupe is actually a traveling group of Were-rats, who do this regularly to adventuring parties, caravans, merc companies, etc. Can the party survive the were-rats treachery? Alternatively, if your players are too suspicious of the troupe, you could change it so they really are a minstrel troupe that has been treated badly by a merc company, and that merc company is coming back that night while the groups are camped to finish the job. Let them get all fearful of the troupe, and then surprise them with the mercs instead.
The not-doing-so-well Well: Water coming from the well has become increasingly red, and has picked up a distinctly metallic taste. This, combined with the increasing rates of disappearing villagers has the locals worried
The Holy Grail: Rumors of eternal life have bounced around for as long as anyone can remember. But only recently has a once-great and now exiled theologian posted a reward for it. He even claims to know of its general whereabouts.
The boiling sickness: The local miners think they've found something dangerous. The further deep they go, the worse the symptoms get. It starts with a rash, and general aches and pains, and moves to internal bleeding of the lungs. Recently, a cave - in was reported, and when the bodies were finally recovered, they were covered in red, swollen boils. Everyone is afraid to return, and some think the source is magical. A local wizard is interested in the truth.
The bishop's ring A bishop from a long forgotten city has appeared in the history records at a bards college. Legend tells of it'd magnificent beauty, and hints at its magical prowess. It seems that after the bishop received the ring from the 'One True God', he was able to communicate directly with the diety. An order of paladins wishes to recover the artifact, and will pay a handsome sum to anyone willing to explore the ancient ruins.
EDIT: It seems that on a large, remote, and tropical island, one Lizard folk is in the mood to unite the tribes. He has taken to slave labor, and is currently constructing a pyramid for him to reside inside. The main - landers fear the uniting of the tribe, and want him buried in his tomb as soon as possible.
The Mating Somethings Haphazardly pinned to the inside of the tavern door and seen on their way out is a torn piece of paper asking for help with vermin harassing a local farmstead. 'Could be .. (the pages is smudged heavily here). Paying well for help! They are ruining my fields!'
Godly Gaffe A priest or priestess had been tasked with guarding a special item until their deity's chosen one arrived to claim it. Well, the chosen one has finally arrived but the holy guardian has already given the item away, very recently! What could have caused the mix-up? Maybe the false prophet used trickery to gain the guardian's trust, maybe the guardian was confused/biased, or maybe there are multiple 'chosen ones'. This adventure could end with the party reclaiming the holy item or meeting and recruiting the additional chosen one.
Unfortunate hookup: While slightly drunk, one of PC hooks up with some beautiful woman. Next day, he gets an invitation to duel at 7 am in front of the town.
Dancing troll Out of nowhere a wild and dangerous troll appears. But he is only dancing because magic shoes force him to do so.
Giant flood Out of nowhere, giant river springs in the middle of the city, destroying all of it. Local wise man claims only great magic or portal could create such river.
Ogre danger An extraordinary huge ogre destroyed a small village and some nearby farms. But he only wanted to play...
Feed the Beets: While travelling, they hear a call for help from a nearby field of crops. There, a young farmer is being attacked by a Blight. After saving the farmer, she offers the party a visit to a local fairy spring in exchange for helping to find why her crops have gone mad and started biting. This sets up to a fight against a large Blight or evil Treant.
Long Live the King: The party encounters a revenant whom they recognize as the recently deceased king, who supposedly died of natural causes. The king's successor is only a few days away from his coronation ceremony. Something seems to prevent the revenant from revealing the real circumstances of his death.
Arcane Wreckage News of a shipwreck reaches the ears of the party. This ship however was built to house a huge magical weapon and is now available to whoever gets there first.
Ribbit Season A local rare frog breeder has been deliberately poaching wild frogs so that he has a monopoly on the lucrative hallucinogen the frogs sacreet.
Snake on a Plain: On a barren plain, a deadly Bone Naga has been terrorizing travelling caravans. They are sick of this snake and so they resort to contracting the party to hunt it down.
The Nightman Cometh Rumours of The Nightman circle the town, saying he is starting a cult on the outskirts of town. The Nightman is a nocturnal monk that said to be a master of martial arts. He has cat like eyes that he uses to peer into people's dreams, corrupting them, causing a wave of nightmares through the populous. Whether these rumours are factual or not, a cowardly noble has put out a bounty on The Nightman.
Forest Grump: In a small forest town, a general store has been burgled by bandits. The vindictive owner now feels powerless, so he decided to train until he is ready to take the down the bandit camp himself. All day he runs through the town, silently, leaving his store closed. The town needs his store to open, but the owner just keeps running.
Club for Fighting In a largish city, the party is invited to a secret, underground Fight Club 'Club for Fighting' that has recently started up. The only problem is that one member won't stop bragging to his friends, which is explicitly against the rules. The party is asked to resolve this.
Taxing Winds: In a small farming town, the nights have become unseasonably cold and stormy, affecting the crops. The townsfolk point to three white dragonborn sorcerers, who have all only been seen while in the presence of the area's vicious tax collector.
A Demonish Dillema: The soldier in a small castle has been possessed by a demon, and he is told to overtake the castle in the name of said demon. He poisons the ruler and the ruler falls into a coma. The soldier starts recruiting any and all bandits/trouble makers that find their way near the castle, and begins his attack on the castle.
An Eye For Trouble: While entering town, the group is accosted by a one-eyed man who asks the adventurers to get his eye back from a wizard who stole it as a spell component for some new spell she was researching. The only problem is that she's traveling with a company of Mercs, who don't take kindly to someone troubling their company mage.
The Night Unremembered: Awaking sore and disgruntled, the party finds themselves locked away in prison on charges of murder and a number of petty misdemeanors. The penalty for murder is the noose. The party must convince the grizzled old magistrate of their innocence and follow their midnight murderous meanderings to uncover the truth.
The Road Less Traveled By On their adventures, the party stumbles upon a fork in the road. Splitting to the left is a road worn with years of travel to a well known port city. The other path appears brand new and untouched. Mysterious lights flicker in the distance.
Murder Most Fowl: A string of killings occurs in the local village. Every morning a body appears in the square horribly mutilated by numerous small blunt objects. Despite attempts to catch the culprit, the town watch reports never seeing the crime happen or having fallen asleep at their post. At the scene of the crime is always a duck with a blood crusted bill.
The Roadside Wager: A pair of wealthy looking gentlemen can be seen having a good-natured argument as they travel down the road. Recognizing the party as adventurers, they bid the heroes settle a matter from their own 'wilder youth'. One believes the treasure they sought in a nearby ruin was never there to begin with; the other is sure had they been more skilled in those days they would have prevailed. They are no longer interested in the treasure, but who is right.
Chained Green Near a farm at the outskirts of town, the heroes encounter a single emaciated goblin. The pitiful creature is clad in a single rag, and the lash marks it bears tell of its time as a slave. The goblin and its tribe have been conquered and enslaved by the local village. The newfound peace and extra workforce is allowing the settlement to boom.
Strange Customs After a very merry night with some traveling gypsies, the party awakens to find that according to some vague tradition, they have adopted one of the gypsies. It is now their responsibility to take them into the wastes as part of their coming of age ceremony.
At A Loss For Legacy: The only local ruling families to ever keep their hold on the throne had heroic bloodlines. The baron and his wife have the wealth, political skill, and connections, but not a drop of heroic blood. It is a well known rumor that any adventurer who can gather some fame with their exploits will spend time in the lap of luxury as a court concubine. Then again, I did only say the baron's family seeks to add heroic blood, didn't I...
Golden Years, Golden Child: A man near crippled by old age begs for your help. He tells a story of how he was a chosen sacrifice and his youth was stolen. If the ones who did this were dealt with, he would become a child again. At least he thinks so. See, the problem is even magically aged old men have trouble remembering things, and now this chosen one isn't that sure on the details...
Not Quite Special Someone You've just finished looting adventuring in that old crypt when you are approached with a reward you were most definitely not expecting; an arranged marriage. Turns out that old king had a habit of speaking in metaphor and a court wizard who took things literally. 'A commoner will marry into this family when he pries the rings from my cold dead hands!'
Balance Rumors abound, whispering of one rising in infamy just as quickly as your own glory grows. They appear to be your opposite in nearly every way; tactically, morally, physically, only the same in power. Is it coincidence, or prophecy? Whatever it is, this antithesis of yours seems to be drawing closer.
Resurrection gone bad First post wasn't on topic, so I'm back for more: Of course, not all resurrections are made equal. Sometimes the plant reagents have gone bad, or the wrong ones were picked. Sometimes the person had been dead for too long. And sometimes, like this time for instance, part of the characters soul was invaded by a parasite upon reentry into the physical world. Slowly, she loses the spark of life. She can still move, still talk, and is as strong as ever, but her voice has gone flat and her appetite has disappeared. At first you thought it was some sort of depression, but then last night happened. Out of the blue, her magic stopped working. The high counsel of wizards suggest you kill her again, and capture the soul as it leaves her body. This way, you can separate host from parasite, but of course, this is a dangerous, and risky process. And hasn't been tried for many centuries. Books will need to be dug up from ancient tombs, and long lost reagents found. This'll be a long one, but your characters very soul is at stake. Better act fast before there's nothing left!
What happens when you revive a human sacrifice? Well, it turns out it depends on the diety. Some are more than happy to oblige, but others, the darker gods, want to keep what's theirs. And they punish those who would try to steal from them. And this one happens to do so by raising the dead. If you can take what's his, he can take what's yours.
The Chosen One? Since birth, you were told you were the chosen one. The ultimate mover and shaker of the centuries. Only - now you've lost your one-ness. It seems that you've been possessed, and this creature, this seed, this thing inside of your mind, digging and burying itself further inside of your consciousness, thinks that you're not the chosen one. It is. You find yourself acting in your sleep, unable to remember what you've done. Sometimes it takes over during the day, and you can't come close to fighting its power. It acts in ways you would never imagine, and seems to be planning something against your will. It pushes you to accept quests, and reject others. All with one thing in common: blood magic.
To bring him back? Or just make another?: Resurrections aren't easy you know. They're expensive, and a time consuming process. And it doesn't always work. But you've heard tell of a cheaper way, Cloning. A wild outcast of a tinkering gnome thinks he's found a way to clone living tissue. All he needs is a spell which will extract the memories from a living being. Such a shame that the only wizard who knows of such things is evil, and living at the top of a tower a long, long way south.
But really, what's the difference between necromancy and resurrection?: That's what Elbert asked himself while studying his ancient tombs over 40 years ago. 'Isn't necromancy giving life to what is already dead? And shouldn't they do what I bid? I was the one giving them life. I was the one who put purpose back into their cold and rotting corpses. It's a small cost to pay, and I'll free them eventually! All I have to do is find a way...' Or so he told himself. 40 years later, and he's hidden himself away in the catacombs, surrounded by the dead, and all alone. He believes that he can fracture the soul of a living person, and give it to the undead. Little does he know, he's making a lich that MUST be stopped.
Robbed, then Framed Inside a busy town, the party is robbed by a passing vandal. Following a small chase scene, detailed with the typical cart dodging and stall vaulting, the party will catch the thief in some dead end alleyway. Palms up, swearing no trickery, the thief will return the party's stolen belongings. The thief will also helpfully forfeit some of his other stolen wares as well. Returning to the market place, a well armed group of guards will stop our merry band of adventurers. 'In the King's name, your are charged with breaking into the high vault of the Royal Treasury. Stand down, criminal scum, and accept your punishment - death!'
Royal Getaway The Prince/Princess has never left the extent of his/her kingdom, and is interested in learning about the faraway lands detailed in his/her history books. Of course, the King and Queen hardly want to see their precious child runaway into certain danger. The Royal Child is offering an ample sum for the party to take the prince/princess as an additional member of the party. Be warned, however, should the Child encounter any danger and not return unharmed, the wrath of the Kingdom will fall against our fair adventurers.
Pirate Band Sailing throughout the Seven Seas, there lies pirate band, pillaging all that they please. The watch has been called, a bounty is set, the whole kingdom moves to oppose threat. Yet, fair adventures, know this to be true! Beware of their captain, else he'll run you through! A bard of wicked rhythm, a rapscallion musician; He'll crush any pirate hunter's foolish ambition!
A Funny Thing Happened on the Quay by the Forum A merchant from a distant city has arrived, swathed in acres of silk, and has managed to simultaneously undercut and outprofit nearly every fishmonger on the quay, seemingly overnight. No self-respecting angler will admit to selling fish to the foreigner, and the local guild is considering artificially inflating the price of seafood so that other merchants can compete. More troubling, several of the waterfront's resident urchins/couriers/pickpockets have gone missing, and reports of dark shapes in the water have caused the watch to establish ban on swimming.
All's Quiet on the Warlock Front: The sudden reappearance of the Warlock Prince after almost twenty years abroad has the arcane networks abuzz, and hedge wizards, hermit sorcerers and socialite bards alike have been invited to attend the ceremonial recrowning. Conspicuously left out? Your (wizard/warlock/sorcerer/bard/cleric).
Ravenloft and Greyhawk are Dead Simultaneously, every creature in every facet of existence hears the same plea - 'The Planes are Dying! Woe! The Planes are Dying!' - followed by an empathetic barrage of every emotion conceivable. It's over almost before it started, and only a select few are able to stop gibbering for long enough to parse the meaning of the message.
A song to follow: After a long day on the road, the party settles in a small, lively inn. As soon as the party's bard starts playing (or, if the party lacks one, the local fiddler), a beautiful, yet eerie woman starts singing strange lyrics to the melody that describe a way through the local country side to an abandoned house and end with the words: 'Party Face's Name found the lone hound's hall / and recognized it well / and by the very last breath's call / they ended the demon's spell'. The mysterious singer cannot remember anything, but will repeat the words when the tune is played again.
The Cursed Coin In the middle of the path ahead of the party lays the body of an old man, with a large gold coin clutched in his cold hand. At first glance he seems dead, but once any one of the adventurer's touches the gold coin, he rises into the air with glowing green eyes, as the coin fuses with the palm of their hand. A booming voice emanates from the old man and informs them that they are now cursed to carry the Coin of Mammon (Demon of Greed) until they too die. With this the old man crumples to the ground in a heap. On further inspection of the old man, a map is found, the destination of which merely says 'Mammon'....
The Thirsty River A mother and child rest at the side of the road suckling on sweat soaked bandanas. When they see the adventurer's they ask for water and tell them about a curse that's been laid on the town just up the road. The river flows with fresh water but when the water enters a person's mouth it turns to sand. A local coven has cursed the town for breaking a deal with them.
Mirror Image: A covered mirror, found the by the party, turns out to be magic. It shows a glimpse of the future (based on the character's background) by altering the appearance of whatever is reflected in the mirror (this can be the appearance of the character including physical features or clothing/equipment, or the surrounding location). Characters roll a d20 to determine how good or bad what they see is (the lower the roll, the worse, and the higher, the better). At the end of their vision, a second d20 is rolled to determine if something they saw (such as a scar, wound, armor, or location effect like a building behind them being on fire) is permanent in the real world (10 or lower, something is permanent, 5 or lower ensures it is something bad, a critical 1 requires it to be a serious injury, and a critical 20 provides a powerful boon). One character sees a vision of himself shattering the mirror. Any attempt to shatter the mirror fails - it cannot be broken by any standard means.
A Kitchen Nightmare The city is abuzz, as word has spread that a great and world famous chef, Riordan Gamsy, has come to the city and will be cooking a meal for the king. But, in order to cook this exquisite meal, he will need exclusive and rare ingredients procured for him, and sure enough the kingdom hires the PCs to acquire said ingredients. The list is full of hard to obtain ingredients, such as a moss that only grows on the bodies of zombies, and the meat of a Bullette, etc., you get the point. But, after gathering all these ingredients, and bring them to Chef Gamsy, he has to admit to the PCs that he doesn't actually know how to cook very well. He's a con man who just kind of stumbled into this gig of being a world famous chef. He makes lists of ingredients that he knows no one in their right mind would ever gather, and lives off the generosity of the king/queen/etc. while waiting for the ingredients to be procured, and then when they fail to procure the ingredients, he gets huffy, says he will not compromise his art, and then moves off to the next kingdom. No one has ever been able to get all the ingredients before, and he doesn't know what to do now, as this lord will actually be expecting him to create a mind-blowing meal with the ingredients the party has gotten. First he'll beg the party for help, but if they refuse he'll threaten the party, saying that if they don't help them with his situation he'll tell the lord that they were in on the scam as well, and they'll all go to the chopping block together. What does the party do?
Friend of the Family: A stranger comes-a-calling, and requests to speak with the PC's late great relative of some kind. PC explains that relative has been dead but you recall hearing stories of Aunt/Uncle stranger name, yet they look as though they haven't aged a day. The stranger is struck with WoE for with as many years they've spent on this plane, they often forget the passing of time. (Family Friend is either Revenant/Vampire/Lich...etc.) They came to call upon your deceased relative because they require aid. Perhaps the PC will be willing to answer the call?
Lost Heir(s) to the Throne: Old King Zac has no trueborn children. So when he dies, agents of the kind arrive in your far-flung village, and reveals that you are in fact the long-lost bastard son of the king! However, the old king got around. There are dozens of other bastards, of all ages and races, half-orc, half-elf, tiefling, aasimar, oread, undine, plain old human, dhampir, on and on. The king's ministers declare that all of his heirs shall vote to choose the heir to the kingdom from amongst themselves. A vote shall be held at the end of each day, until one heir holds a plurality of votes. Murder of your half-children disqualifies you on the spot. Go! Compete with your half-siblings for the ultimate power in the kingdom! The king's will demands it!
The Roadmage: A mage covered deep in cloaks and his two guards ride up to the party while they travel and ask if they can join until [name city]. He does not want to pay or anything and will ride in silence behind the party, even his guards seem very silent.
The Noble Bullies Every peasant parts way as this group of three nobleman's sons walk through with their personal guards. A young street kid does not see them in time and falls to the ground when he runs into the middle one. This nobleman's son immediately challenges him to a duel and one of the others throws him a rapier, when he picks it up it is clear that he never used one. The guards turn away and form a haphazard circle.
Mushroom harvesters Early in the morning in this small hamlet the party wakes up from hush voices and the sound of rolling barrels. When looking out from the barn where they stay they see a small squad of goblins rolling in barrels into the towns center. When given time people from the houses come outside and walk up to them like it is no big deal and trade freshly found forest mushrooms for jugs of milk and pieces of woven cloth.
The drunken troll When walking upon an off-road stone bridge between villages sits and old troll, he is singing and is drinking from a barrel. When the party comes close he demands wine and ale for the crossing. He seems very sensitive about the state of his bridge, he thinks it is beautiful.
The best salesman A street merchant stumbles up to strangers and asks if they want to buy special medicines, potions and charms. When you even listen for a moment he will lock onto you and start to sell you random stuff, he is very charming but a bit to up-close for comfort. It is like he is using magic to compel you to buy buy buy....
A small mistake When walking through a crowded city street two large men left up the smallest party member under the armpits a few inches of the ground and without hesitation move through the crowd towards an alley. A shady figure is waiting there, is there some kind of mistake or is this a blast from the past?
Lives at Stake: In a small hamlet they players encounter a very helpful man, they are allowed to sleep in his barn for the night. But have to promise that whatever they do they do not come in his house. When (yes, I said when and not if) they do they notice a woman, clearly his wife. Thing is, she has a wooden stake through the lower part of her neck, it looks painful and she can not fully turn her neck. Anyone ever heard of a Pointanak?
A Sword's Mind: It is your normal Ogre hunt job, you get told where and when it will be anywhere and your job is to poke enough holes in it to make it stop moving.

But what is that, glistening inside this enormous wooden beam, a sword deeply embedded shining like the day it was made.
Beauty hides Betrayal Travelling through a thick forest, it starts to get dark but open spaces are rare. But the party stumbles upon one, a large rotten tree flattened against the forest floor, overgrown with purple flowers and surrounded by a few meters of open space. The smell of the flowers is insane, insanely hallucinative. When paying attention old remains of animals litter the underground, turned to fertilizer....
The Beggar: An old homeless man approaches the party looking for some spare food/change. If the party takes pity on him, he reveals himself to be a wizard that has fallen on hard times and grants them some kind of magical benefit for a short period. If they dismiss him, or act harshly toward them, he curses them, turning their (entire party or just particularly cruel characters) tongues to stone before vanishing, making it so those players can no longer communicate with words. The party must then find him to remove the curse.

Almost Magical Goods: A local merchant approaches the PCs to help him out. He swears that someone has replaced his magical goods with 'almost equivalent' versions - a bag of 'sort-of' holding, a belt of somewhat useful items, potions of temporary healing, etc. The city merchant's guild is threatening to put him out of business for swindling customers, but he swears he's being set up.

One for One People are dying under mysterious circumstances in the capital city, and the healers & clerics can seem to find no cause for their deaths, as the victims just drop over dead for no apparent reason. Of course, what the town doesn't know, and the PCs are going to have to find out, is that an evil Lord has found a way using dark magic to resurrect the dead, but the cost is the life of another in the area. This Lord is currently busy in the catacombs underneath the city, using the dark magics to raise an army of the evilest, vilest, most loathsome individuals interred there, to help him take the capital, and the kingdom, and in the process he's killing the victims in the city above as collateral damage.

You remember seeing them on the tomb of a mummy on display at your local museum, perhaps that old pile of rags and bones knows how to get in?
The life tree An elf with tousled hair and leaves hanging from his strange armor jumps at you from out of nowhere. He thrusts a small, frail looking, potted plant into your hands and says 'You must be the one I was supposed to meet, here take it!

He then turns into an eagle and soars away, leaving you with the little potted tree.
The Werewolf: You come upon a town that looks like it has been attacked by savage beasts. The townsfolk tell you of a Werewolf that has managed to kill all the Alpha wolves in the forest and now has all the wolves following him.

An attempt on the King: The king was attacked from afar with an arrow. Thankfully one of his men jumped in front of the arrow and saved the king.

You heard earlier that a shipment of arrow shafts and heads got stolen from the Dwarfs and there is a town nearby called Roost where everyone is a chicken farmer.

The drug crazed dragon: Two dragons have been known to slumber in the ruins of an ancient city for a long time. Aztorkin or Venom, the Green Dragon has been breathing his toxic fumes into the old sewers of the city for many years, to make sure no one can attack him from below. Kartharnix or Acid, the Black Dragon has slumbered for long on the other side of the ruined city. He has many slaves under his command which he sends into the sewers to mine the green hardened resin of Venoms toxic breath. Acid has figured out that when he slowly melts the resin with his acid it creates a vapor that fills him with ecstasy. However recently Acid learned that his neighbour Venom had been slain some years ago, and when his slaves informed him there was no more resin to mine, the dragon went insane. Supposedly he now tears the city apart frothing at the mouth, melting stone and steel in search of his fix. Soon he will direct his anger elsewhere, if he is not stopped.

The lighthouse keeper has filed complaints that the Bullywugs living in the swamp have gone from their usual bumbling selves to an organized terrorist group!

It's dated more than 600 years ago, and instead of bearing only the crest of the royal family on the back, it has an emblem with the royal families crest and 3 other crests from families you do not know. A lot of things have gone missing near the old Gnome wizards house. Not a lot of people go near it since the old gnome was found mauled to death in his laboratory. Not that people went near it when he was alive either. However a woman nearby has had all her threads and needles stolen repeatedly. Another woman reported her wedding dress missing. A few people have gone missing too and there have been reports of weird noises around the old house.
The Spectral Inn: You are starving and parched from long travel without nourishment. Walking into the first tavern building you see, you notice immediately how empty it is, and the innkeeper greets you enthusiastically, talking your ear off about a story you never asked for. As he gives you food and some time passes, you notice the wood slowly warps, cobwebs appear in the corners, and light dust has made its way onto the surfaces. As you finish your meal and make your way out, you find that the innkeeper is nowhere to be found, the doorway is boarded up, and the inn appears older than your grandfather's grandfather.
Something in the Woods: A logging camp has been abandoned by its work crew, who refuse to go back to collect their equipment, or even personal belongings left behind. None of the loggers can tell you why, beyond an overwhelming feeling of terror.

A local Cleric of Bahamut proclaims the end of days if the infestation is not stopped, and approaches the party and tasks them with ending the plague. 'Thou hath been chosen by Bahamut to commit wyrmling genocide'.
'I AM ANNOYED WITH YOU! TAKE SPEAR AND PROVE LOYALTY TO ME! I WILL NOT MISS AGAIN!' One day, a masterwork spear made entirely of iron is seemingly thrown from the sky, causing a small earthquake as it strikes the ground at the feet of the party half-orc.
The Pretender Ressurected The Queen is a tyrannical douche, having assassinated her way to the throne and murdered the rightful heir to the throne, her much more benevolent brother. A good-hearted necromancer has ressurected her brother, turning him into an intelligent undead creature not unlike a death knight, who desires to retake his rightful kingdom and end the rule of the tyrant Queen. Despite his zombie-like appearance, his benevolent attitude has earned him the favor of the (less conservative) peasantry.

It Belongs in a Museum: The party is tracked by an archaeologist, who claims one of the PC's family heirloom is actually a priceless artifact from a long lost culture, and that the PC's parent/grandparent/etc must've been one of the thieves who robbed a famous excavation site decades ago.
Mama's Baby, Papa's Maybe For generations, a dragon has been harassing a province. Twenty years ago, oracles prophesied a child would be born from the convergence of two noble houses who would then grow up to vanquish the evil. The party encounters the child of prophecy, now an adult warrior, in a tavern, drunk and despairing. He only now discovered his mother was having an affair when he was conceived.

What few survivors there are return with news of a great whistling noise and a mirage-like island appearing just before the winds swept their boat to crash upon a reef or rocky shoal.
The Hungry: The Necromancer's first-risen despairs at the endless pain of his existence. His master gave him life - or something close to it - but all he feels is an absence that cries out to be filled.

Perhaps with his master's death he may find an end - one way or another.
The Turncloak The youngest son of a noble house at whose castle the party is currently laying siege, slips out of the castle and into besiegers' encampment.

The Turnsail: On a moonless night, after 'acquiring' an ancient elvish artifact from the manse of one of the city's most powerful merchants, the party races to the harbor to make their escape.

The Turnsword Over breakfast, the party receives a note from the captain of a mercenary company whom they have employed: 'They are willing to pay me more. The price is double, or I walk. This is business, not personal.'
The Prickly Princess: One morning after a night of carousing in the city, the party is met by the Watch in the street, clasped in irons, and marched off to a jail cell. The following day, the princess who had formerly been very friendly visits them. She heard about some forays into a certain brothel whose madame has been most slanderous about the royal family.
The Turnkey A notorious outlaw Beardo the Black has been captured and is now rotting in a cell in the city's prison thanks to the heroic efforts of the party. Early the following morning after a night of celebrating, the party is summoned to the prison at the behest of the captain of the City Watch. When they get there, the captain and the chief gaoler tell them that the outlaw has escaped and the turnkey on-duty has been killed, his head smashed repeatedly against the stone floor. The guards on-duty say that no one has entered or left the prison save the warden, the captain, a few guards changing shifts, and the afternoon turnkey leaving after the now-dead turnkey arrived.

The Dive: After recovering a hard-fought haul in a tomb or ancient ruin, the party arrives back in town to tuck into some ales at their favorite dive bar. Tedd the barkeep greets them warmly. Nilla the barmaid smiles knowingly as she sways around the bar to bring her favorite heroes their usual libations. Halfway through the first round of drinks, the party members start to feel a bit dizzy. Tedd trudges across the barroom and says, 'I had no choice. They arrive right before you did. I'm sorry.' The bar is now crowded with crossbowmen in mail, wearing purple and black cloaks.
The Mole: Gethers the one-eyed, grotesquely fat boss of the Dead Mouse Gang with whom you've worked before dismisses the pair of lackeys that accompanied him to meet you here at this pub. 'Someone is informing on me. Someone on the inside. Lord Commander Hodge has been waiting for us at the site of three of the last four drops from some of our smuggling contractors. We've stayed out of it, but I'm running out of smugglers. I need you to find the mole.'
Turnabout is Foul Play: After enrolling in a tournament of skill, agility, and strength at the behest of their mysterious sponsor, the party discovers that nearly every challenge has been rigged against them. At first, it's simple, petty things; an arrow without fletching, a set of weighted die. But when a steeplechase across town ends in the tragic deaths of a beloved noblewoman and her lover, all signs point to something more sinister.
The Turn of the Shrew Old Heddy has for years been the go-to gossip for up to date news on the goings on of all aspects of life in the city. For the price of a drink and a little ribald conversation, she could be relied on to dispense a juicy tidbit or two on who may have been seen stepping out with whom, and what dock may have received a secret shipment of godshit. But when the party attempts to pay her a visit in her customary corner of the Heron's Bill, she hisses, spits, and gives them the evil eye; the bartender - a wise man - advises they run.
Turn After Reading: A struggling restaurateur has hired the party to do the unthinkable - sabotage his competitors. A renowned critic of all things gastronomic is in town, and the poor chef's only chance of receiving a favorable review is to shine in comparison to his peers. The adventurers are provided a simple map, a vial of something noisome, and a hefty sum of unmarked coins, and are sent out into the streets to wreak some culinary espionage. When they arrive at their first destination however, they find that the poison isn't just putrid - it's deadly.
You Live, You Turn: When a notorious Viscount betrays the party, it comes as no surprise - already wary of traps and duplicitousness, they make their escape from his mountain manor with ease. But many months later, while traveling through a port city, they're alarmed to find a wanted poster hanging from the door of the inn, the windows of the shops, and in the hands of the sheriff's deputies. To add insult to injury, the list of supposed crimes verges on the ridiculous, including things like 'Theft of the Crown Prince's Dreams' and 'High Treason Against the Unified Tonalities of A Flat Minor'. Nevertheless, the local law seems intent on prosecution, and the only alibi they have rests on the word of a man who has already betrayed them once, and seems likely to do so again.
The Poacher A small group have been hunting a certain animal/magical beast to extinction, and willing to threaten or kill the druids trying to protect their land. One of the poachers is willing to help kill his fellow poachers for the right price/favor.
Under New Management: You return to your favorite inn and/or brothel to find that the original owner of the establishment has met an unfortunate and bloody end.

Everything seems just a little too neat and tidy...
No Loose Ends The party has just killed the Big Bad, and they're returning to Castle Goodguy for their just reward. They're battered, they're bloody, but they're victorious.

The party has been ordered executed, and the order comes straight from the Crown.
A Change of Heart A fearsome knight in black armor approaches the camp at night, unarmed and asking for parley. Upon interrogation, he reveals that his master, the cruel king of the neighboring realm, is planning on slaughtering the firstborn of every household. While he would much prefer to kill the adventurers and be rid of their meddling, his honor demands that he seek the help of the most able to avert this atrocity.
Make Her Pay: The youngest son of a noble family hires the party to find and kill a witch who has been warping the minds of the populace. Upon further investigation, the girl is not a witch, but in fact an ex-fiancee who spurned his advances when she learned of his own delvings into the black arts.
Shanghaied: The Horses Replacement is one of the rowdiest dockside inns in Brightbluff, so it's par for the course when a group of rough looking half-orcs invite the party to a drinking contest. The drinks go down easy but win or lose, they'll be drunk and tired by the end of it. Unfortunately for them, the bitter old ex-cavalier who runs this establishment has a deal worked out with the half-orcs and their accomplices, and a discreet set of tunnels under each room wind their way right to the water and their boats. Passing out at the inn, they'll find themselves miles out to sea and suddenly the newest unwilling crewmembers (or slaves) aboard ship.
The Ranger Who Couldn't Catch a Break While traveling in the forest, the floor suddenly collapses beneath a member of the party, and they narrowly avoid being speared by the ranger hiding within the pit trap. As the ranger stares at them, his eyes widen in fear and he murmurs, 'Oh gods, not again...'
A Slightly Unhelpful Wizard As payment for their most recent job, the party is given a bag containing a set of incredibly light plate armor, an ornate stopwatch, and a dagger emanating with a seemingly heatless flame. At the bottom of the bag is a small piece of parchment with an address written on it.
Onwards, noble steed! One of the party's horses - the Paladin's War Steed, maybe? Suddenly turns wild and bucks off its rider, just as they are about to charge into combat. It will not allow its former rider to approach, let alone ride, although other people may be able to lead it.
My Castle Now The PCs, having acquired wealth and noble standing after many adventures, come home from a hard month's dungeoning to discover that their loyal castellan is no longer so loyal, and has barred the gates against them, claiming the castle as their own. Can they besiege their own fortress?
Rumors of Betrayal: The party arrives in a city where the King is away on a crusade, but the Queen is still around. They party goes about their business, until after a day or so, they realize that people are starting to stare at them and speaking in hushed tones behind their backs. Sooner or later the party will discover that there is a rumor floating around that the King has taken a lover while off on crusade, and has now sent that lover back to the kingdom for his/her safety. Of course, one of the party members is that rumored lover. Who's behind these rumors? Is there a secret lover trying to shift blame to someone else? Is a lord or lady trying to make some sort of power play? Is the thieves guild trying to stir up troubles to distract from their actions? Can the party stop the rumors? And what will happen when the Queen hears of these rumors?
Death rides a Pony! The avatar of Death appears to the party, and tells them he will be taking them all during their next dungeon. Buuuutttt, he will give them a pass if they help him recover his steed, which has been stolen by one of the other Horsemen. The problem is that he doesn't know which of the other Horsemen has his stallion, and so Death expects them to approach each of the other Horsemen about it. Of course the other Horsemen won't just give up info about the theft, the party will have to figure out ways to make the Horsemen cooperate.
Constructing Trouble: A wealthy town has a detachment of Golems that are used in the town defense. A squad of mages builds and maintains these automaton guards. What these mages don't know is that one of their apprentices is in actuality a powerful mage for the opposing side who has managed to make sure during the creation of each Golem that there is a command word embedded inside them to allow him/her to take control of said Golems when the time is right. Such as when the opposing side has an army outside to take the city mayhaps?
Mutiny! The party are resigned to a week or so aboard The Dowager Bride, working their passage across the Mirror Sea to the Outer Isles. The Captain, Morrun Jake, was loath to take them but has agreed eventually on account of the Bard's sea shanties or the Cleric's blessing or the Wizard's knowledge of Arabay legend, or somesuch. The deal is struck in a dockside bar, after a long spell drinking with the Captain, his first mate, the Bosun, and the Purser. Every day the sun shines, the sea is calm, and the wind is good. Every evening includes a spell at the Captain's table for at least some of the party, eating, drinking, telling stories, gambling a little. The rest get to break bread with the ordinary seamen. In between some work swabbing decks, stitching sails and repairing the rigging, the party has ample time to heal up, learn spells, swap stories, and practice weapons skills on the deck with various interesting sea-dog types. Friendships are made, and maybe some friction too in places. But a quiet interval between adventures is just what the doctor ordered. Until last bell on the third Friday at sea when Black Pete the Purser and Carter the Bosun slit Jake's throat as he sleeps and claim the captaincy. The crew are split and it looks like it's going to get ugly. With the party having good relations with some on both sides, how will the they play it?
The haven The party is currently fleeing danger, they conveniently come across a friendly person who offers them refuge to avoid their pursuers. Little does the party know that this person is a sadist/torturer/killer and once they get into the person's house they'll be featured in the new SAW movie.
The healer: Someone in the party has been afflicted by a curse, the local healer says that that person can be cured but it will cost greatly, demanding huge amounts of coin for 'reagents' and other precious materials the party conveniently has. Once they have given enough the healer will ask for sacrifices, such as pints of blood and pounds of flesh.
The highwayman: As the party walks down a road they're approached by a single -apparently unarmed- shady looking fellow, he asks the group if they're in for a quick buck. Once they agree, the highwayman will tell them that a caravan of merchants is due to pass by that same road in a matter of minutes/hours, but he can't take them on alone. Once the PCs assault the caravan, the 'merchants' reveal themselves to be bandits, partners to the shady fellow.
The Judas Have a minor henchman idolize someone in the party, he will mess up once in a while but that's because he's clumsy. The first moment the party starts causing mischief he will sneak out one night and offer guards info on the party in exchange for money.
The Medic A young person claims to be a medic and it's searching for some herbs to make a cure. He does 'warn' the group about the dangers they're about to face. Each time they come back the medic needs yet another (more dangerous) reagent for his cure. The 'warning' could be something like: 'Be wary, the leaves of X plant might be poisonous in a large enough dose'. But he conveniently omitted the massive cloud of noxious spores the plant segregates when threatened.
The protege A very liked NPC (usually young) who follows the party has his/her own goals, after following them for a while that person realizes that reaching that goal won't come soon. Have a different band of 'adventurers' appear as a rival match for the party, eventually making the protege
Lovers: The party encounter a lone young dandy, Joraldo Callico, on the losing side of a drunken fist-fight with a hulking stevedore, Henk. Joraldo, love-lorn and in his cups, had made the mistake of lustily insulting the Scheffer family scion, Konrat Schefferson, within earshot of Henk. He works for the Scheffers. Most of the stevedores do around this part of the docks. Turns out the Callicos (southern hosiery and silk scarves) and the Scheffers (furs and leather from the north) have a long-standing and bitter mercantile feud. But Joraldo, a relatively unimportant young nephew of his family's current head, cares about the feud only in-so-far as it prevents him from marrying the love of his life, Kirstel Scheffersdotor, youngest daughter of Konrat himself. He shows the party the letters she has sent him, and describes how she is practically kept prisoner since broaching the subject of marriage with her father. Her last letter implores him to free her so that they can elope together. If the party can unite the lovers at the Crocus Inn by midnight tonight, they can have a barrel of Callico gold and as many silk scarves as they can carry, plus Joraldo's undying thanks. Springing Kirstel is a big job, and fraught with danger, but, assuming that they successfully deliver the beautiful, doe-eyed, love-struck girl to Joraldo and his surprisingly large retinue in an upstairs bedroom at the designated rendezvous, he will be overjoyed, handing over the reward and thanking them profusely as he suddenly drives a serrated dagger up under Kirtsel's ribs whispering, 'Callico honour! Death to Scheffer dogs!' into her shocked and pain-twisted face. Whatever way the subsequent events immediately unfold ... How long will it take before the Scheffers get their revenge? Where, when, and how will it manifest?
Retirement Home For Former Heroes At a ribbon cutting ceremony for a newly funded home for aged out adventurers, the keynote speaker Mack the Medicocre, has been turned to stone.

The party has to find some of Mack's old enemies and recover the scroll so he can be turned back to normal.
Will He or Won't He The party receives a contract from the Thieves' Guild to recover a particularly rare jewel, on behalf of an unnamed noble who is sponsoring the contract. The next day, the party's rogue (or the least trustworthy member) is contacted privately by the guildmaster's lieutenant. If the rogue will secretly return the jewel directly to the guildmaster, with the other party members none the wiser, he can collect the entire payment for himself. Will he take the chance? What if the lieutenant offers a path to promotion within the guild? How will he pull it off?
The Racist: In light of a recent catastrophe, a well-known public figure declares extermination of a minority (tieflings work best here). PCs need not be the minority, but works best if they have emotional connections to the marginalized
Fried Piper of Hamlin A bard shows up in a town pushing an Organ (or whatever large musical instrument suits your fancy).
